# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Power BI Dashboard
Project Objective: This project involves the development of a comprehensive weekly credit card dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends. The dashboard is divided into two sections: customers and transactions. It offers insights into various aspects such as total revenue, interest earned, delinquency rates, categories of card owners, expenditure types, income levels, customer jobs, education levels, card types, and customer segments.

The dashboard also includes week-on-week, month-on-month, and year-on-year comparisons to track changes over time allowing for detailed analysis and meaningful deductions.
